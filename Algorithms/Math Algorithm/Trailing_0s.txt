Find the number of trailing zeros in 500!.

The number of multiples of 5 that are less than or equal to 500 is:
500/5 = 100

Then, the number of multiples of 25 is:
500/25 = 100/5 = 20

Then, the number of multiples of 125 is:
500/125 = 100/25 = 20/5 = 4

The next power of 5 is 625, which is greater than 500.

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros of 1000! is:
100 + 20 + 4 = 124
